Welcome to the Banking Console Tool!

This tool has been developed to help you generate a mini statement file in .csv format containing the previous 5 transactions of the user. The tool is written in your preferred programming language and comes with the following features:

- The tool will generate a .csv formatted file in the current directory.
- You will be prompted to enter your name and birth year as input.
- The tool will then generate the user_id as per the following example: Name: Ryan Reynolds, Birth Year: 1976 user_id: RYA_REY_1976
- You can store dummy data of the transactions for the generation of files.
- The tool should fetch the previous 5 transactions of the user and generate the mini statement file.
- The file contents should be under the following headings: S.N., Date, Time, Amount, Balance followed by 5 rows of previous transactions
- The name of the file generated should be the same as the user_id.
- The tool should be easy to use.

Please note the following constraints:

- The current balance in each transaction should match its amount.
- You canâ€™t use any third party packages, you have to use only inbuilt functions provided by the programming language.

Scoring will be based on completion percentage and code quality.

As a bonus, you can generate a template file and use it for generating mini statements file and include error handling.

The workspace contains two folders by default:

     src: the folder to maintain sources
     lib: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the bin folder by default.

If you want to customize the folder structure, open .vscode/settings.json and update the related settings there.

To get started, simply run the Java program and follow the on-screen instructions to create your account, deposit or withdraw funds, generate a mini statement, or check your account balance.

Thank you for using the Banking Console Tool.
